# 6S4P-Battery-Thermal-Management-Cooling-Plate-Study

Objective:

Evaluated effects of:

Cooling surface exposure

Convection coefficient (h)

Cooling method (natural vs forced vs liquid-equivalent)

System Description:

6S4P cylindrical cell pack

Heat generation: 0.27 W per cell

Aluminum cooling plate

Conjugate heat transfer analysis

Cases Studied:
Case	Cooling Condition	h (W/m²K)	Tmax (K)
1	Bottom face only	~Natural	356 K
2	Bottom + sides	10	348 K
3	Bottom + sides	50	312 K

Key Insights:

Surface area exposure reduces peak temperature

Increasing h drastically reduces thermal resistance

Liquid cooling improves safety margin significantly
